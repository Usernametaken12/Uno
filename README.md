# Uno
A relatively simple program to play Uno with other players or against an AI. Currently does not have a graphical interface but may at some point in the future.

To run this you can either install a jre or use an online java runner like this one: https://www.online-ide.com/online_java_editor Simply upload all the files in the project and run the one titled UnoRunner.

Please let me know of any bugs that exist in the program so that I may fix them. Thanks!
